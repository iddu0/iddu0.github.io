<h1>IDDU01 CLICKER</h1>
<p>This is iddu01 clicker, a clicking game I made after I saw clicking games on scratch really blowing up. There are currently 2 diffrent versions of the game. One is for the micro:bit, and one is for Scratch. The one for scratch can be found here: [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/836111474/].
The one for the micro:bit can be found here:[https://github.com/saadit111/saadit111.github.io/blob/main/files/Projects/IDDU01%20CLICKER/microbit-IDDU01-CLICKER.hex]</p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<h3>Scratch</h3>
<p>The scratch version is the simplist version to play, being the version with the GUI, and the mouse cursor, so  you can easily click things. To play, click the iddu01 in the middle, and 1 click will be added to your total clicks. At the bottom left, you can see your total clicks and your click mutiplier. Currently, the click multiplier has not been coded yet. On the left side is a Button that says "Ports". When this button is clicked, it will show the ports that this game has been ported to.</p>
