<h1>Hacking a VTech watch.</h1>
<h3>Custom home screen wallpapers.</h3>
<p>I was thinking that if we go into the system files, there must be a line of code that tells the watch that when we switch the default homescreen wallpaper to another built in one, the  piece of code will say something like = HEY! THE USER SET THE WALLPAPER FROM defaultwallpaper.jpg TO fancywallpaper.jpg. SO CHANGE THE WALLPAPER TO fancywallpaper.jpg!</p>
<p>This means if we get ant image we want, and change it's name to fancywallpaper.jpg, it will set thw wallpaper to the custom wallpaper <strong>you chose. </strong>I have not tested this yet</p>
<h3>Custom lock screen wallpapers.</h3>
<p>This is very simple. All you have to do is open the DOWNLOAD folder, and open the PHOTO folder. In that folder, upload any .jpg photo.</p>
<p>Next,open the app that is a clock with a photo icon. Click the icon that has a smiley face clock with a plus button. Then, select the photo book icon, and select the uploaded photo.</p>
