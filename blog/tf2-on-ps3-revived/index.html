<h1>Team Fortress 2, on PS3 - Revived!</h1>
<p>Before we start, I just want to say: Happy belated New Year! OK, back to the blog.<br><br>
Yes, you read that right. A dedicated team of modders has revived the PlayStation 3 version of Team Fortress 2!</p>

<h3>Before we start, a little bit of PS3 TF2 backstory...</h3>
<p>Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer first-person shooter game released by Valve. It is the sequel to the 1996 Team Fortress mod for Quake and was released in 2007. The PS3 version is a bit different though...<br>
The PS3 port of TF2 came with The Orange Box for PS3. It also was <strong>not</strong> made by Valve. Instead, Electronic Arts, or EA, were the people that made the PS3 port. You may be thinking: "Ok, so what's so bad about EA making 
TF2 for the PS3? And that's where disaster struck...<br>
When EA made TF2 for the PS3, they made it so you have to connect to <strong>their</strong> servers if you want to play the game. Even if you want to play locally, with no multiplayer, you will be faced with a "Cannot connect to EA 
Servers" screen. A picture will be included below (maybe)<br>
The Xbox 360 version of the Orange Box does <strong>not</strong> have this problem, as Valve designed the 360 version, and made it connect to their servers. Also, Valve has NOT shut down their servers. (as of 2/5/2025)</p>
<h3>So, how were the servers revived?</h3>
<p>A genius developer & modder, that goes by @wav3 on Discord, figured out how to reverse engineer the servers to connect to a custom server. In fact, you can make your own server, which I shall cover in another blog post.<br>
But other people did work, too! @XAD on discord, who is the RE:TF2_PS3's discord server's admin, also did some work trying to fix the server, (as of my knowledge.). Also, @Spring Lane XI did a LOT of work as well! So, if you are wondering
who to thank, thank them!</p>
<h3>Things to keep in mind:</h3>
<p>  -This will <strong>only</strong> work on RPC3S (ps3 pc emulator). It has not been tested yet.</p>
<p>  -A non modded PS3 may work, if Real PS3 hardware ever comes. However, it is extremely unlikely, as you need to modify game files to do this mod.</p>
