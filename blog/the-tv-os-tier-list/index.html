<h1>TV's are kinda dogshit.</h1>

<p>Story time: My LG Oled TV didn't have a Jellyfin app for the longest time. Minor problem. But really, it's wild that LG doesn't allow you to sideload apps. It is common though, with Apple not allowing it, and Amazon, with their new VegaOS moving away from sideloading.
  So how do you solve this? Change your TV Brand.<br><br>

<h3>Wait, what?</h3>

I dont mean that you should go and buy a new 8K ULTRA HDR TV with 720 FPS that costs $10,000. I mean just change the TV Box. The question is WHICH TV box should you buy? Well, if you're an Apple person that uses a MacBook for work, has an Apple Watch on their wrist, makes
calls with an iPhone, and listens to beats with AirPods, then walk (not run) to a store and get an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/apple-tv-4k/">Apple TV 4K.</a><br>
Let me explain: The Apple TV is the best TV box if you are deep into the Apple Ecosystem. It syncs seamlessly with the ecosystem, has cool features, and more. Controlling your tv with your phone and Siri is a great bonus.
If you Want to sideload apps, want the most powerful device for your money, and <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/221099988-setting-up-and-managing-plex-media-server-on-nvidia-shield/">(maybe want to) host your own Plex Media Server</a>, then go for the Nvidia Shield Android TV (this tv was SO powerful (used the same chip as the Nintendo Switch) 
that it could run a full Plex Server). Our family has had a Shield TV for 5 - 10 years, and it STILL works fine. 100% reccomend this (even though i'm an apple fanboy)<br>
Like Google? Get a Google Streamer. It works seamlessly with Google Home, runs good, is Google (introducing more spyware), and has a clean UI.<br>
What else? Oh yeah, the Fire Stick. These things are Garbage, but also good? The first gen has NO USEABILITY these days (netflix isnt even supported anymore) and the new ones, they might just overheat and run slow. Now you might be wondering why I mentioned the First Firestick.
Well, I belive that products should still be useable after they are old. The Shield TV Still works, iPhones work for a LONG time after discontinuation (same for Android), PC's still work, and more.<br>
So get a Firestick if you just want something that "just works".<br>
Also, I guess I'll mention Onn (walmart). They also make some VERY CHEAP but VERY GOOD boxes that just work.</p>
