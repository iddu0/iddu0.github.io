<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>My name is Aadit Sharma, also known as iddu01. I make stuff and I also play video games. Here you can find projects that people made that I also made, projects that I made alone, and some other files. Just click the "Files" button on the top left corner.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>I take my photos of my projects and other things with a iPhone 6s. This phone is great because it is budget friendly, records 4K video at 30fps, and takes photos at a 3024x4032 resolution.<br>Fun fact:The iPhone 6s was my first phone, and the one I used to take photos was my first phone! I just found out it takes 4K video!</p>
